# Budget Buddy for Android

This is a nice little personal Android app  to track and manage expenses and budget (hence the name, until I come up with something better :D )

It uses the backend implemented in [the original webapp](https://github.com/ricardochavezt/budget-buddy).

(It has also been the perfect excuse to explore Android Architecture Components and the implementation of the
Clean Architecture patterns).
